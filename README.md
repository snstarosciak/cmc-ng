# CoinMarketCap List

This is a sample angular project created to demonstrate `ngrx` integrated into a table view that lists the top 100 cryptocurrencies on https://coinmarketcap.com

The table is sortable by column and you can filter out which cryptocurrency you want to view by name or symbol

Just run these commands and it should run locally:

`npm i`
`ng serve`
